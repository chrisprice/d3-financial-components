This example shows how a more complex chart can be built using the d3fc components.

The three charts that make up this example are each [linear time series](../../components/chart/linearTimeSeries.html) charts. The top-most chart uses the [gridlines](../../components/annotation/gridlines.html), [crosshairs](../../components/tool/crosshairs.html) and [candlestick](../../components/series/candlestick.html) components, rendered via the [multi-series](../../components/series/multi.html) component. The volume and navigator charts uses a similar mix of components.

These charts all share the same underlying data, however, this is enhanced with the data that represents the current interactive state.

The top-most chart uses a tooltip component that was written specifically for this example application. It is added as a 'decoration' of the crosshair.
