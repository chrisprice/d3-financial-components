A [Relative Strength Index](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_strength_index) is an indicator that plots the historical strength or weakness of a stock based on opening and closing prices. It is typically plotted on a 14-day timeframe and is displayed next to overbought (70%) and oversold lines (30%) lines.

The RSI indicator is rendered on a percent scale:

You can configure the number of datapoints that are included in the RSI via the `windowSize` property, you can also change how the open and close values are read via the `openValue` and `closeValue` properties.
