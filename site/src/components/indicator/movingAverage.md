A [moving average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) is an indicator that smooths out fluctuations in data. This component computes a [simple moving average](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average#Simple_moving_average) for a given data field, averaging the previous 5 points by default.

D3FC indicators are comprised of two component parts:

 + The indicator algorithm, which is applied to the input data. The algorithm computes the indicator and merges the result back into the source data (although this behaviour is configurable).
 + An optional indicator renderer, that converts the algorithm output into one or more series / annotations.

Simpler indicators do not require renderer with their output readily rendered via a simple series.

The example below creates a point series and a moving average:

You can configure the number of datapoints that are included in the moving average via the `windowSize` property, you can also change the object property that is averaged via the `yValue` property.
