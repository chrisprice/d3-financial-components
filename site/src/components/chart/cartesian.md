The cartesian chart is a component that combines a pair of scales, axes and labels with a 'plot area' which is a container where the associated series are rendered. The cartesian chart is responsible for the overall chart layout, ensuring that the axes are correctly aligned and the scale ranges are set accordingly.

The following simple example shows how to construct a cartesian chart, where a pair of linear axes (x and y), are supplied to the component factory function. The chart is responsible for setting the `xScale` and `yScale` properties of the series associated with the plot area:

```js
{{{example-code}}}
```

This results in the following chart:

<div id="cartesian-chart"> </div>
<script type="text/javascript">
(function() {
  {{{example-code}}}
}());
</script>

A number of the more [complex examples](/examples) use the cartesian chart as the basic 'boiler plate' for constructing a chart.

By default the series within the plot area are cropped to fit. This ensures that nothing obscures the axes. When this is not required (e.g. when rendering data annotations over axes) add the series to the plot area overlay instead.
