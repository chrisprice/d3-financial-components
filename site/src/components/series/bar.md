The bar series renders the given data as a series of vertical bars:

```js
{{{example-code}}}
```

Which gives the following:

{{>example-fixture}}

This series has the same `xValue`, `yValue` and `decorate` properties as the [point series](#point). You can also specify the width of the bars via the `barWidth` property.
